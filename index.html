                <h2>
                    A little intro</h2>
                <p class="first">
                    I’m a Microsoft.NET C# developer with over twelve years experience in architecting
                    and developing software systems using industry recognized patterns and practises.
                    I’m a proponent of test driven development (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" title="Test Driven Developement / Design">TDD</a>) and the natural fit that it has
                    with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"
                            title="Agile Software Development">Agile</a> and <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org"
                                title="eXtreme Programming">XP</a> development methodologies. I’m interested in messaging based event
                    driven architecture (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture"
                                            title="Event Driven Architecture">EDA</a>) and the loose coupling it achieves which in turn allows
                    for scalable systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m also a proponent of domain driven design (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">DDD</a>) as a way of bringing development
                    closer to the business and effectively delivering business requirements whilst also
                    delivering a system which mirrors in the code the way the business should run. Another
                    paradigm I’m investigating and working with is command query responsibility segregation
                    (<a href="http://www.udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs/"
                                    title="Command Query Responsibility Segregation">CQRS</a>) which nicely deals with the impedance mismatch between relational data structures
                    and the object orientated manner in which we should be working with our subject
                    matter as developers amongst many other pertinent advantages.</p>
                <p>
                    Most of all I believe in continuous learning. I develop software because I enjoy
                    the constantly changing nature of the environment and that it is always in a state
                    of flux, for the better.</p>

                <h2>
                    More about me</h2>
                <p class="first">
                    I live in south west London with my family and make a living architecting, designing
                    and developing windows and web-application systems using Microsoft technologies
                    and industry recognized patterns and practices. I love technology and I love staying
                    current. There is nothing worse than feeling like you’re being left behind. It was
                    the constantly changing and challenging nature of Information Technology and software
                    development in particular that drew me to a career in building applications.</p>
                <p>
                    I love building things, slowly taking small pieces and putting them together so
                    that the whole is greater than the sum of its constituent parts. There is something
                    intriguing in creating something, seemingly from nothing. This is why I enjoy software
                    development. I enjoy the process of architecting and then developing a solution,
                    of problem solving and designing. I love standing back and looking at what has been
                    achieved and drinking in that feeling of satisfaction, of achievement.</p>
                <p>
                    Over nine years I have worked in a range of different environments from small software
                    development houses to large international industry specific firms. I have thus acquired
                    exposure to and appreciation for the agility and responsiveness required of start-ups,
                    developing software for a variety of differing target markets, and the stringent
                    procedural controls of established corporations with set development methodologies
                    and practices.</p>
                <p>
                    I'm interested in improving software development methodologies and finding better,
                    more efficient and more reliable ways of developing software to a high standard.
                    As such I'm interested in test driven development (TDD) and the whole Agile / XP
                    paradigm of building software applications. I'm constantly wanting to learn new
                    and innovative practises which improve the delivery of software and so I've looked
                    at Lean and variants of that such as Kanban.</p>
                <p>
                    At an enterprise level I've latched onto domain driven design (DDD) as a way to
                    make software meet business requirements instead of merely technical requirements,
                    after all software is for the business! I'm also interested in command query responsibility
                    segregation (CQRS) and the obvious spin-off of using event sourcing and NoSql /
                    document databases.</p>
                <p>
                    As you can see I’m still learning… This is what it’s all about.</p>

                    I worked primarily as the team lead on a large project for an international Energy company developing a Transfer Pricing management tool.

                    The solution we provided made use of Oracle, server side service components and a WPF user interface.

                    I worked as part of large team developing a budgeting application for the firms
                    internal budgeting and cost monitoring of matters. The application was a web based
                    tool relying on data from disparate systems from finance to firm control work management
                    systems. Users of the system would budget costs of estimated work catering for different
                    partners, fee-earners and other resources at different exchange rates. The budget
                    was then eventually compared against actual outcomes of work done on a matter and
                    various reports were available to help monitor the progress of a budget.</p>
                <p>
                    The budgeting tool was developed using agile / XP practices and methodolgies. Daily
                    stand-up meetings, bi-weekly development iterations and breakdown of work into stories,
                    tasks, defects and spikes. the application was developed in ASP.NET with ASP.NET
                    Ajax 1.0 for a responsive, interactive UI.</p>
                <p>
                    The MVC/Model 2 architecture was used and test coverage of over 90% was achieved
                    on the code base. The application interacted with multiple firm-wide components
                    using WCF services and messaging using SOAP over TCP resulting in a loosely-coupled,
                    service orientated enterprise architecture.</p>
